      <h3>Heres a breakdown of how to use the application</h3>
      <br>
      <img src="1.jpg">
      <P>1. A list of requirements to fulfill the equation. Click on the white box to the right of the wording to type in the needed variables</p>
      <img src="2.jpg">
      <p>2.1. The calculate button. Press the button to calculate the total cost of your 3D print. When clicked, a .TXT file will be entered into the programs folder with the end result.</p>
      <p>2.2. The end result being a organized list of every variable combined into the sum cost. A popup will appear after clicking, comfirming the file creation.</p>
      <img src="3.jpg">
      <p>3. Displays the total price at the end</p>
      <p>4.1. Input the values needed at the white box above. Incorrect answers (such as letters in questions related to money) will be ignored, but the program cannot detect 'slip-ups'</p>
      <p>4.2 No symbols are needed for the values, just the numbers or wording requested.</p>
      <p>5. When the .TXT is created, it will ALWAYS show up in the same folder in the program. This will likely be changed in a future version.</p>

      <p>The program may change in future versions. Thank you again for using PrintCC!</p>
