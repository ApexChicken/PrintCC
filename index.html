<h2>About this application</h2>
<p>PrintCostCalcultor (or PrintCC) is a simple program I made to help with finding the prices of 3D prints. I wanted this to be avaliable to anyone who needed something like this, or just for me to help with uploading to other devices.</p>
<p>Hopefully, if you decide to use this, this will help you in some way. Cheers! - The Developer</p>

<p>To help with learning the software, heres a simple guide on how to use it!</p>
<p>When you open the application, you will see an popup that should look similar to below.</p>

<br>
<h3>Heres a breakdown of how to use the application</h3>
<br>
<img src="1.jpg">
<P>1. A list of requirements to fulfill the equation. Click on the white box to the right of the wording to type in the needed variables</p>
<img src="2.jpg">
<p>2.1. The calculate button. Press the button to calculate the total cost of your 3D print. When clicked, a .TXT file will be entered into the programs folder with the end result.</p>
<p>2.2. The end result being a organized list of every variable combined into the sum cost. A popup will appear after clicking, comfirming the file creation.</p>
<img src="3.jpg">
<p>3. Displays the total price at the end</p>
<p>4.1. Input the values needed at the white box above. Incorrect answers (such as letters in questions related to money) will be ignored, but the program cannot detect 'slip-ups'</p>
<p>4.2 No symbols are needed for the values, just the numbers or wording requested.</p>
<p>5. When the .TXT is created, it will ALWAYS show up in the same folder in the program. This will likely be changed in a future version.</p>

<p>The program may change in future versions. Thank you again for using PrintCC!</p>
