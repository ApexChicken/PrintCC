ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to PrintCC! This is an open-source, simple Python program I have made to help people simplify the process of finding the costs of 3D-printed parts. The project attempts to be very 'modular' and easy to use. It is current in early versions and may be for a long time.

If you intend to copy the code or remix it in some way, that you provide credit to me. Thanks!
