# Welcome to PrintCC!

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to PrintCC! This is an open-source, simple Python program I have made to help people simplify the process of finding the costs of 3D-printed parts. The project attempts to be very 'modular' and easy to use. It is currently in its early versions and may be for some time.

If you intend to copy the code or remix it in some way, that you provide credit to me. Thanks!

*BTW I do not claim to be an expert programmer.

# More About the Program

PrintCC was made several months before this repository was created, but I realized that maybe, other people might have a similar problem as I did; the inefficient and confusing mess that is calculating the price of your designs. From losing track of a variable, to the confusion of finding correct equations to solve for. PrintCC is still a very active repository/program I'm working on, and I welcome anyone willing to help with it! It's open source, and free for everyone to use, as long as they don't use it for exploitation of any sort.

# The Numbers
The current equation for calculating the price is as follows:

C = ((u/a) * f  + t * r + d * m) * (1+p)

C = cost

u = filament used

a = filament amount bought

f = filament cost

t = print time

r = print rate

d = model design time

m = model design rate

p = profit margin

You can probably tell why each variable goes in that spot, but if theres an error in the equation, let me know! The equation may change if more variables are added.


# Expansion!

As I have said before, this project is constantly under construction, and is improved every day! Those willing to contribute to PrintCC are greatly appreciated! Considering it's simplicity, its a great place for python programmers to start, and for more experienced software engineers to expand and contribute on a helpful project!
